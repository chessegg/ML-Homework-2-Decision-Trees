This project is about decision trees (id3 trees). The questions in the homework are pretty well annotated and will give
you a clear idea about the material.

The ipynb files allow you to directly see the questions and the code.

The Assignment 2 Report PDF file contains a PDF style report of how all the outputs should look. This is also a backup
option to view all the code if for some reason the ipynb Jupyter Notebook style code does not work for you.
