This project is about decision trees (id3 trees). The questions in the homework are pretty well annotated and will give
you a clear idea about the material.

In order to view the questions and the code, after downloading the zip file, open command prompt and change directory
to the proper directory containing all the files. Then, type in "jupyter notebook" and a localhost jupypter notebook
tab should open on your browser. Both the decision_tree.ipynb and the learners.ipynb files contain my code and answers
to the decision tree homework questions.

The Assignment 2 Report PDF file contains a PDF style report of how all the outputs should look. This is also a backup
option to view all the code if for some reason Jupyter Notebook does not work for you.
